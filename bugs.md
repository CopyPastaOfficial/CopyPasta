# List of bugs in the mobile app

- When you add a device and you click on "Enter the information manually", and you click on "Scan Qr code" and you click on the return button, you will redirect to the home page and not to the add page of the device
- If you scan QR Code of WiFi or Calendar for exemple, the title is in english and so there is a problem of translation.
- When you would like share the last scan, if the scan is for exemple a calendar, you can't share with a calendar app (I think it's not important at the moment but I think I will solve this problem in future updates.
- When you change the orientation of the device, the card where is the last scanned text disappears.
- I will add a option to send the last scanned text, because if there is a error of communication, then the user will send the text.
- I will add the permission for the storage, even if the app works, it's better to add them.
- When scanning something, the text "Scan or choose a picture from gallery" changes font or weight or letter spacing (i don't know).
