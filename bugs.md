# List of bugs in the mobile app

- When you add a device and you click on "Enter the information manually", and you click on "Scan Qr code" and you click on the return button, you will redirect to the home page and not to the add page of the device
- If you scan QR Code of WiFi or Calendar for exemple, the title is in english and so there is a problem of translation.
- When you change the orientation of the device, the card where is the last scanned text disappears.
- I will add the permission for the storage, even if the app works, it's better to add them.
- When scanning something, the text "Scan or choose a picture from gallery" changes font or weight or letter spacing (i don't know).
- You can't take a photo in the app to send image, you can only get a image from the gallery.
- When you don't accept the permission to the first time, when you close the app and open the app, when you scan something with the camera, a message shows (to enable permission) and this message is not in full.
- I will add a option to send the text from the clipboard.
- When you make a long click on a device in the first page, there is a problem with a lot a device, you remove the device (it's the objective) and you will redirect to the device at the bottom.
- The scan of QR CODE don't support visit card (there is not label)
- When showing the loading bar at the bottom of the topbar (after scan text or send image), when you scroll, the loading bar is not in the foreground. 

- When you would like share the last scan, if the scan is for exemple a calendar, you can't share with a calendar app (I think it's not important at the moment but I think I will solve this problem in future updates.
